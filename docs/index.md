Our AI recognizes biomes, entities and weathers (we are still working on those ...). When you start playing Minecraft, it supplies knowledge about the enviroment: 

"Hi, you are in a forest and its raining now"
"Here's a pig in front of you."
"You are in the desert and the current weather is clear."

Isn't that cool to have tour guide to walk you through Minecraft?
